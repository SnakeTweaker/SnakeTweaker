SnakeTweaker

Also known as CJ, novice programmer looking to better my skills and expand my portfolio. Currently studying C.S. W/ S.E. concentration @ SNHU. My goal is to attain my B.S. within the next 2 years, so a lot of studying and hard work to do. 

I’m interested in Retro computing, video games, game development. My life goal is to develop my own video game engine. I also would like to create a few games of my own. 

I’m currently learning C++, C, Python, Lua, C#... I find lessons on Udemy and do simple projects. In school I am finishing CS210(C++/Python) and working my way towards IT230(C#) and MAT243(Python). For gaming I'm most comfortable using Unity, however I'm considering jumping into Unreal Engine to get a feel for things.

I’m looking to collaborate on Video games, scripts for reverse engineering modding software.
